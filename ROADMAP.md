# 🗺️ Visionary Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic vision for the Gemini CLI Helper, categorizing features from foundational essentials to ambitious, "God Level" capabilities. Our goal is to create a powerful, extensible, and intelligent tool that becomes an indispensable part of the developer ecosystem.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Q1)

**Focus**: Core functionality, stability, security, and basic usage. These are the critical must-haves that ensure the tool is reliable and user-friendly.

- [x] **Account Management**: Seamlessly log in and out of your Gemini account.
- [x] **Local Backups**: Create and restore local backups of the Gemini configuration.
- [x] **Cloud Backups (B2)**: Initial implementation of cloud backups with Backblaze B2.
- [x] **Rate Limit Tracking**: Basic tracking of API rate limits.
- [x] **Automated Updates**: Check for and install updates to the underlying Gemini CLI.
- [ ] **Interactive Configuration**: A more interactive and guided process for setting up the tool for the first time.
- [ ] **Improved Error Handling**: More robust and user-friendly error handling and reporting.
- [ ] **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed documentation for all commands and features.

---

## Phase 2: The Standard (Q2)

**Focus**: Feature parity with top competitors, user experience improvements, and robust error handling.

- [ ] **Multi-Cloud Provider Support**: Add support for other cloud providers like AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage.
- [ ] **Advanced Backup Options**: Implement more advanced backup options, such as incremental backups and custom backup schedules.
- [ ] **Configuration Profiles**: Allow users to create and manage multiple configuration profiles for different accounts or projects.
- [ ] **Enhanced UI**: A more polished and user-friendly command-line interface with improved visualizations and feedback.
- [ ] **Detailed Reporting**: Generate detailed reports on API usage, backup status, and other key metrics.

---

## Phase 3: The Ecosystem (Q3)

**Focus**: Webhooks, API exposure, 3rd party plugins, SDK generation, and extensibility. This phase is all about integrating with other tools and services.

- [ ] **Webhook Notifications**: Send notifications to services like Slack or Discord when key events occur (e.g., a backup fails, a rate limit is approaching).
- [ ] **REST API**: Expose the tool's functionality via a REST API, allowing other applications to interact with it programmatically.
- [ ] **Plugin Architecture**: Develop a plugin architecture that allows third-party developers to extend the tool's functionality.
- [ ] **SDK Generation**: Automatically generate SDKs for popular programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript) to make it easier to interact with the REST API.
- [ ] **CI/CD Integration**: Provide official integrations with popular CI/CD platforms like GitHub Actions and GitLab CI.

---

## Phase 4: The Vision (GOD LEVEL) (Q4)

**Focus**: "Futuristic" features, AI integration, advanced automation, and industry-disrupting capabilities.

- [ ] **AI-Powered Insights**: Use AI to analyze API usage patterns and provide intelligent recommendations for optimizing performance and reducing costs.
- [ ] **Automated Configuration Drift Detection**: Automatically detect and report on configuration drift between different environments.
- [ ] **Self-Healing Capabilities**: Implement self-healing capabilities that can automatically resolve common issues without user intervention.
- [ ] **Decentralized Backups**: Explore the use of decentralized storage networks for even more resilient and secure backups.
- [ ] **Natural Language Interface**: Allow users to interact with the tool using natural language commands.

---

## The Sandbox (Ongoing)

**Focus**: Wild, creative, experimental ideas that set the project apart.

- [ ] **Gamification**: Add gamification elements to encourage best practices and reward users for actively managing their accounts.
- [ ] **Community-Sourced Plugins**: Create a marketplace for community-sourced plugins and extensions.
- [ ] **Blockchain Integration**: Explore the use of blockchain technology for secure and transparent audit trails.
